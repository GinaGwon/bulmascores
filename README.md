# Bulmascores

Hello, I am Bulmascores. A starter theme for Wordpress that uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). 

Do you want to use Webpack + Sass + ES6 and all the latest good that these technologies have to offer? 

You can download take the theme, and run npm install, and you are all set! For directory structures and how to get started guide, go to the documentation (link to documentation page).

Bulmascores is also integrated with Timber (Optional) templating engine, so you donâ€™t have to write the ugly Wordpress loops that makes your code messy. 

Inspired by [Underscores](https://underscores.me/), and [Understrap](https://understrap.com/), Bulmascores tries to reduce the project set up time for your next Wordpress website. 

Focus on your website, instead of spending time to set up your project. 

Bulmascores is integrated with Webpack, so you can bring Sass and latest ES6 javascript functionalities to your wordpress project!



## Getting Started

5 minutes setup:
* Download the theme, upload theme to your new Wordpress site. 
* Activate the theme in your wordpress backend.
